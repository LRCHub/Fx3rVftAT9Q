20,000 leagues under the sea
That's where my baby said he'd meet me
20,000 leagues under the sea
That's where he said I'd have to be

20,000 leagues, down, down, down
20,000 leagues, down from town
20,000 leagues worth of breath
20,000 leagues nearer to death

20,000 leagues under the sea
That's where my baby said he'd meet me
20,000 leagues under the sea
That's where he said I'd have to be

20,000 leagues into the deep
20,000 leagues to a watery sleep
20,000 leagues of fish and sharks
20,000 leagues of gloomy dark

20,000 leagues under the sea
That's where my baby said he'd meet me
20,000 leagues under the sea
That's where he said I'd have to be

20,000 leagues, would you be there?
20,000 leagues, I didn't swear
20,000 leagues where sea weed is red
20,000 leagues where starfish are dead
